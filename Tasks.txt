Tasks:

    -Edit existing teams
        -PUT method to alter the existing data at /teams/team_id

        -Blank slate with "Add Mon" button

                -When mon is clicked, show fields that can contain possible moves as well as a name, sprite, and stat table
                -Maybe set up fields for lower priority attributes?
                -"Add" button at the bottom that returns user to add mon page, though they can see their already-added mon
                    -"Add" also adds the mon to a temporary array that stores the added mons until the POST method is run

            -modify those team objects as the battle proceeds
            -once all mons on one side have died, set finished to true and start the timer to delete the battle
            -this gives us easy access to all actions in case we want to display them
